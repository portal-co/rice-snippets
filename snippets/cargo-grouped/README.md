# Cargo Dependency Snippets (Grouped)

This directory contains dependency sections split by logical groupings
(separated by blank lines in the original Cargo.toml files).

## Naming Convention

Files are named: `{repo}_{section}_group{NN}.toml`

Where:
- `{repo}` is the repository name
- `{section}` is the dependency section (e.g., `dependencies`, `workspace-dependencies`)
- `{NN}` is the group number within that section

## Usage

These smaller snippets allow you to copy just the dependencies you need
without including unrelated packages.

Total grouped snippets: 192
